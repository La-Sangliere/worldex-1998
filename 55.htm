<p>
<b>Economy&#151;overview:</b> Beginning in late 1978 the Chinese leadership has been trying to move
the economy from a sluggish Soviet-style centrally planned economy to a more
market-oriented economy but still within a rigid political framework of Communist
Party control. To this end the authorities switched to a system of household
responsibility in agriculture in place of the old collectivization, increased
the authority of local officials and plant managers in industry, permitted
a wide variety of small-scale enterprise in services and light manufacturing,
and opened the economy to increased foreign trade and investment. The result
has been a quadrupling of GDP since 1978. Agricultural output doubled in the
1980s, and industry also posted major gains, especially in coastal areas near
Hong Kong and opposite Taiwan, where foreign investment helped spur output
of both domestic and export goods. On the darker side, the leadership has
often experienced in its hybrid system the worst results of socialism (bureaucracy,
lassitude, corruption) and of capitalism (windfall gains and stepped-up inflation).
Beijing thus has periodically backtracked, retightening central controls at
intervals. In 1992-97 annual growth of GDP accelerated, particularly in the
coastal areas&#151;averaging about 10% annually according to official figures.
In late 1993 China's leadership approved additional long-term reforms aimed
at giving still more play to market-oriented institutions and at strengthening
the center's control over the financial system; state enterprises would continue
to dominate many key industries in what was now termed "a socialist market
economy." In 1995-97 inflation dropped sharply, reflecting tighter monetary
policies and stronger measures to control food prices. At the same time, the
government struggled to (a) collect revenues due from provinces, businesses,
and individuals; (b) reduce corruption and other economic crimes; and (c)
keep afloat the large state-owned enterprises, most of which had not participated
in the vigorous expansion of the economy and many of which have been losing
the ability to pay full wages and pensions. From 60 to 100 million surplus
rural workers are adrift between the villages and the cities, many subsisting
through part-time low-paying jobs. Popular resistance, changes in central
policy, and loss of authority by rural cadres have weakened China's population
control program, which is essential to maintaining growth in living standards.
Another long-term threat to continued rapid economic growth is the deterioration
in the environment, notably air pollution, soil erosion, and the steady fall
of the water table especially in the north. China continues to lose arable
land because of erosion and economic development; furthermore, the regime
gives insufficient priority to agricultural research. The next few years may
witness increasing tensions between a highly centralized political system
and an increasingly decentralized economic system. Rapid economic growth likely
will continue but at a declining rate. Hong Kong's reversion on 1 July 1997
to Chinese administration will strengthen the already close ties between the
two economies.
