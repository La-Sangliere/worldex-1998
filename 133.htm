<b>Economy&#151;overview:</b> Kazakhstan, the second largest of the former Soviet republics in territory,
possesses enormous untapped fossil fuel reserves as well as plentiful supplies
of other minerals and metals. It also has considerable agricultural potential
with its vast steppe lands accommodating both livestock and grain production.
Kazakhstan's industrial sector rests on the extraction and processing of these
natural resources and also on a relatively large machine building sector specializing
in construction equipment, tractors, agricultural machinery, and some defense
items. The breakup of the USSR and the collapse of demand for Kazakhstan's
traditional heavy industry products have resulted in a sharp contraction of
the economy since 1991, with the steepest annual decline occurring in 1994.
In 1995-97 the pace of the government program of economic reform and privatization
quickened, resulting in a substantial shifting of assets into the private
sector. The December 1996 signing of the Caspian Pipeline Consortium agreement
to build a new pipeline from western Kazakhstan's Tengiz oil field to the
Black Sea increases prospects for substantially larger oil exports in several
years. The emigration of large numbers of skilled Slavic managers and technicians
from the northern industrial areas will hold back future growth.
