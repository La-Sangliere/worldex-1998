<p>
<b>Economy&#151;overview:</b> At independence in 1948, plantations growing tea, rubber, or coconuts
and paddies growing rice for subsistence dominated Sri Lanka's economy, and,
as late as 1970, plantation crops accounted for 93% of exports. In 1977, Colombo
abandoned statist economic policies and its import substitution trade policy
for market-oriented policies and export-oriented trade. Sri Lanka's most dynamic
industries now are food processing, textiles and apparel, food and beverages,
telecommunications, and insurance and banking. By 1996 plantation crops made
up only 20% of exports, while textiles and garments accounted for 63%. GDP
grew at an annual average rate of 5.5% throughout the 1990s until a drought
and a deteriorating security situation lowered growth to 3.8% in 1996. The
economy rebounded in second half 1996, however, and continued to perform well
in 1997 with growth of 6%. Sustained economic growth, coupled with population
growth of only 1.1%, has pushed Sri Lanka from the ranks of the poorest countries
in the world up to the threshold of the middle income countries. For the next
round of reforms, the central bank of Sri Lanka recommends that Colombo expand
market mechanisms in nonplantation agriculture, dismantle the government's
monopoly on wheat imports, and promote more competition in the financial sector.
A continuing cloud over the economy is the fighting between the Sinhalese
and the minority Tamils, which has cost 50,000 lives in the past 14 years.
