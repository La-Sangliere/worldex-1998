<b>Economy&#151;overview:</b> Political and financial crises in 1997 shattered the Czech Republic's
image as one of the most stable and prosperous of post-Communist states. Delays
in enterprise restructuring and failure to develop a well-functioning capital
market played major roles in Czech economic troubles, which culminated in
a currency crisis in May. The currency was forced out of its fluctuation band
as investors worried that the current account deficit, which reached about
8% of GDP in 1996, would become unsustainable. After expending $3 billion
in vain to support the currency, the central bank let it float. The growing
current account imbalance reflected a surge in domestic demand and poor export
performance, as wage increases outpaced productivity. The government was forced
to introduce two austerity packages later in the spring which cut government
spending by 2.5% of GDP. A tough 1998 budget continues the painful medicine.
These problems were compounded in the summer of 1997 by unprecedented flooding
which inundated much of the eastern part of the country. Czech difficulties
in 1997 contrast with earlier achievements of strong GDP growth, a balanced
budget, and inflation and unemployment that were among the lowest in the region.
The Czech economy's transition problems continue to be too much direct and
indirect government influence on the privatized economy, the sometimes ineffective
management of privatized firms, and a shortage of experienced financial analysts
for the banking system. Prague forecasts a balanced budget, 2.2% GDP growth,
5.2% unemployment, and 10% inflation for 1998.
