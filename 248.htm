<b>Economy&#151;overview:</b> Turkmenistan is largely desert country with nomadic cattle raising,
intensive agriculture in irrigated oases, and huge gas and oil resources.
One-half of its irrigated land is planted in cotton, making it the world's
tenth largest producer. It also possesses the world's fifth largest reserves
of natural gas and substantial oil resources. Until the end of 1993, Turkmenistan
had experienced less economic disruption than other former Soviet states because
its economy received a boost from higher prices for oil and gas and a sharp
increase in hard currency earnings. In 1994, Russia's refusal to export Turkmen
gas to hard currency markets and mounting debts of its major customers in
the former USSR for gas deliveries contributed to a sharp fall in industrial
production and caused the budget to shift from a surplus to a slight deficit.
The economy bottomed out in 1996, but high inflation continued. Furthermore,
with an authoritarian ex-communist regime in power and a tribally based social
structure, Turkmenistan has taken a cautious approach to economic reform,
hoping to use gas and cotton sales to sustain its inefficient economy. In
1996, the government set in place a stabilization program aimed at a unified
and market-based exchange rate, allocation of government credits by auction,
and strict limits on budget deficits. Privatization goals remain limited.
Turkmenistan is working hard to open new gas export channels through Iran
and Turkey to Europe, but these will take many years to realize.
