<p>
<b>Economy&#151;overview:</b> At the end of the 1980s, Egypt faced problems of low productivity and
poor economic management, compounded by the adverse social effects of excessive
population growth, high inflation, and massive urban overcrowding. In the
face of these pressures, in 1991 Egypt undertook wide-ranging macroeconomic
stabilization and structural reform measures. This reform effort has been
supported by three successive IMF arrangements, the last of which was concluded
in October 1996. Egypt's reform efforts&#151;and its participation in the Gulf
war coalition&#151;also led to massive debt relief under the Paris Club arrangements.
Although the pace of reform has been uneven and slower than envisaged under
the IMF programs, substantial progress has been made in improving macroeconomic
performance. Budget deficits have been slashed while foreign reserves in 1997
were at an all-time high. And Egypt has been moving toward a more decentralized,
market-oriented economy. These economic reforms and growing investment opportunities
have prompted increasing foreign investment, but incoming capital has largely
been concentrated in stock market portfolio flows. Egypt's economy also has
been hit by a sharp downturn in tourism&#151;a key foreign exchange and job producing
sector&#151;following the 17 November 1997 massacre of foreign tourists at Luxor.
Although Egypt will probably regain these revenues over time, the slump in
tourism is likely to slow the GDP growth rate in 1998.
