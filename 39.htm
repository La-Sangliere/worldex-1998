<p>
<b>Economy&#151;overview:</b> Possessing large and well-developed agricultural, mining, manufacturing,
and service sectors, Brazil's economy outweighs that of all other South American
countries and is expanding its presence in world markets. Prior to the institution
of a stabilization plan&#151;the Plano Real (Real Plan) in mid-1994, stratospheric
inflation rates had disrupted economic activity and discouraged foreign investment.
Since then, tight monetary policy has brought inflation under control&#151;consumer
prices increased by less than 5% in 1997 compared to more than 1,000% in 1994.
At the same time, GDP growth slowed from 5.7% in 1994 to about 3.0% in 1997
due to tighter credit. The strong currency, another cornerstone of the Real
Plan, has encouraged imports&#151;contributing to a growing trade deficit&#151;and
restrained export growth. Brazil's more stable economy allowed it to weather
the fallout in 1995 from the Mexican peso crisis relatively well. Record levels
of foreign investment have flowed in, helping support the Real Plan through
financial shocks in October-November 1997 that occurred in the wake of the
Asian financial crisis. These shocks caused Brazil's foreign exchange reserves
to drop by $8 billion to $52 billion and the stock market to decline by about
25%, although it still ended up more than 30% for the year. President CARDOSO
remains committed to defending the Real Plan, but he faces several key challenges
domestically and abroad. His package of fiscal reforms requiring constitutional
amendments has progressed slowly through the balkanized Brazilian legislature;
in their absence, the government continues to run deficits and has limited
room to relax its interest and exchange rate policies if it wants to keep
inflation under control. Some foreign investors remain concerned about the
viability of Brazil's exchange rate policy because of the country's fiscal
and current account deficits. The government thus has to contend with the
possibility of capital flight or a speculative attack that could draw down
foreign reserves to a critical level and force a devaluation.
