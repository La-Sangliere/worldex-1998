<p>
<b>Economy&#151;overview:</b> The economy of Democratic Republic of the Congo&#151;a nation endowed with
vast potential wealth&#151;has declined significantly since the mid-1980s. The
new government has instituted a tight fiscal policy that has curbed inflation
and currency depreciation. Plans are underway to introduce a new national
currency. Most formal transactions are conducted in hard currency but a barter
economy flourishes in all but the largest cities. Most individuals and families
survive through subsistence farming or petty trade. International investors
show renewed interest, especially in the mining and telecommunications sectors.
However, poor infrastructure, an uncertain legal framework, corruption and
lack of transparency in government economic policy remain a brake on investment
and growth. A number of IMF and World Bank missions have met with the new
government to help it develop a coherent economic plan.
