<b>Economy&#151;overview:</b> South Africa is a middle-income, developing country with an abundant
supply of resources, well developed financial, legal, communications, energy,
and transport sectors, a stock exchange that ranks among the 10 largest in
the world, and a modern infrastructure supporting an efficient distribution
of goods to major urban centers throughout the region. Growth has been positive
since the historic election of President Nelson MANDELA in the country's first
multi-racial elections in 1994, but not strong enough to cut into the substantial
unemployment. Daunting economic problems remain from the apartheid era, especially
the problems of poverty and economic empowerment among the blacks. Other problems
are crime and corruption. The new South African Government demonstrated its
commitment to open markets, privatization, and a favorable investment climate
with the release of its macroeconomic strategy in June 1996. Called "Growth,
Employment and Redistribution," this policy framework includes the introduction
of tax incentives to stimulate new investment in labor-intensive projects,
expansion of basic infrastructure services, the restructuring and partial
privatization of state assets, continued reduction of tariffs and subsidies
to promote economic efficiency, improved services to the disadvantaged, and
integration into the global economy.
