<p>
<b>Economy&#151;overview:</b> In 1997 the German economy, the world's third most powerful, benefited
from robust exports, particularly to other members of the EU and the US, as
well as strengthening equipment investment. But anemic private consumption
and a contraction in the construction industry limited the expansion. Unemployment
continued to set post-war monthly records through the end of 1997 and averaged
4.3 million for the year. In preparation for the 1 January 1999 start of the
European Monetary Union, the government has made major efforts in 1996-97
to reduce the fiscal deficit. This effort has been complicated by growing
unemployment, an erosion of the tax base, and the continuing transfer of roughly
$100 billion a year to eastern Germany to refurbish this ex-communist area.
In recent years business and political leaders have become increasingly concerned
about Germany's decline in attractiveness as an investment target. They cite
increasing preference by German companies to locate new manufacturing facilities
in foreign countries, including the US, rather than in Germany, to be closer
to the markets and to avoid Germany's high tax rates, high wage costs, rigid
labor structures, and extensive regulations. For similar reasons foreign investment
in Germany has been lagging in recent years.
