<b>Economy&#151;overview:</b> Real global output&#151;gross world product (GWP)&#151;rose an estimated 4.0%
in 1997. And, once more, results varied widely among regions and countries.
With its solid 3.8% growth, the US again accounted for 21% of GWP in 1997.
Western Europe grew at 2.5%, not enough to cut into its high unemployment,
and accounted for another 21% of GWP. Japan's faltering economy grew at only
0.9% with its share of GWP at 8%. The advanced countries as a whole accounted
for an estimated 53% of GWP, with overall growth at 3.0%. The 15 former Soviet
republics and the countries of Eastern Europe posted growth of 1.8%, reversing
the long downturn that followed the collapse of communism. Growth varied widely
among these countries, e.g., Ukraine at a negative 3.2%, Russia at a positive
0.4%, and the Baltic countries at a strong 7%. The area as a whole accounted
for 5% of global output. China and India, with a combined population of 2.2
billion or 37% of the world total, grew at 8.8% and 5%, respectively. (China's
official GDP statistics probably are overstated.) The developing countries
as a whole contributed 42% to GWP with an overall growth rate of 5.7%. Externally,
the nation-state, as a bedrock economic-political institution, is steadily
losing control over international flows of people, goods, funds, and technology.
Internally, the central government in a number of cases is losing control
over resources as separatist regional movements&#151;typically based on ethnicity
- gain momentum, e.g., in the successor states of the former Soviet Union,
in the former Yugoslavia, in India, and in Canada. In Western Europe, governments
face the difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare
programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek
employment. The addition of more than 80 million people each year to an already
overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of pollution, desertification,
underemployment, epidemics, and famine. Because of their own internal problems,
the industrialized countries have inadequate resources to deal effectively
with the poorer areas of the world, which, at least from the economic point
of view, are becoming further marginalized. Toward the end of 1997 and on
into 1998, serious financial difficulties in several high-growth East Asia
countries cast a shadow over short-term global economic prospects. The introduction
of the euro as the common currency of much of Western Europe in January 1999
will pose serious economic risks because of varying levels of income and cultural
and political differences among the participating nations. (For specific economic
developments in each country of the world in 1997, see the individual country
entries.)
