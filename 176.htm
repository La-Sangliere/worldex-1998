<b>Economy&#151;overview:</b> Nepal is among the poorest and least developed countries in the world
with more than half of its population living below the poverty line. Agriculture
is the mainstay of the economy, providing a livelihood for over 80% of the
population and accounting for 40% of GDP. Industrial activity mainly involves
the processing of agricultural produce including jute, sugarcane, tobacco,
and grain. Production of textiles and carpets has expanded recently and accounted
for about 80% of foreign exchange earnings in the past two years. Apart from
agricultural land and forests, exploitable natural resources are mica, hydropower,
and tourism. Agricultural production is growing by about 5% on average as
compared with annual population growth of 2.5%. Since May 1991, the government
has been moving forward with economic reforms particularly those that encourage
trade and foreign investment, e.g., by eliminating business licenses and registration
requirements in order to simplify investment procedures. The government has
also been cutting expenditures by reducing subsidies, privatizing state industries,
and laying off civil servants. More recently, however, political instability
- five different governments over the past few years&#151;has hampered Kathmandu's
ability to forge consensus to implement key economic reforms. Nepal has considerable
scope for accelerating economic growth by exploiting its potential in hydropower
and tourism, areas where there has recently been foreign investment interest.
Prospects for foreign trade or investment in other areas will remain poor,
however, because of the small size of the economy, its technological backwardness,
its remoteness, its landlocked geographic location, and its susceptibility
to natural disaster. The international community's role of funding more than
60% of Nepal's development budget and more than 28% of total budgetary expenditures
will likely continue as a major ingredient of growth.
