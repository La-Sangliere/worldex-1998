<b>Economy&#151;overview:</b> In 1997 Estonia's continued implementation of market economic reforms,
disciplined fiscal and monetary policies, and a liberal free trade regime
resulted in GDP growth of 10% and a drop in inflation to 11.2%. Estonia can
point to its inclusion among the first group of Central and East European
countries to begin EU accession talks in 1998 as its most significant economic
achievement in 1997. Other economic strengths include solid investment grade
rating from both Standard and Poors and Moody's, government revenue collection
in excess of projections by more than 6%, growth in exports at a faster rate
than imports, and record levels of foreign direct investment, among the highest
per capita in Central and East Europe. Estonia privatized its shipping company
in 1997, but failed to make as much progress privatizing other large infrastructure/utility
companies, such as Eesti Energia and the Oil Shale company, which it plans
to privatize in the next two years. The growing current account deficit, which
stood at nearly 10% of GDP at yearend 1997, remains a serious concern. In
1998, GDP is expected to grow by 5.5% and inflation to fall 10%.
