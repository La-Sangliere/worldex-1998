<p>
<b>Economy&#151;overview:</b> The northern city Sanaa is the political capital of a united Yemen,
and the southern city Aden, with its refinery and port facilities, is the
economic and commercial capital. Future economic development depends heavily
on the attraction of foreign investment to diversify the economy. Former South
Yemen's willingness to merge stemmed partly from the sharp decline in Soviet
economic support. The low level of domestic industry and agriculture has made
northern Yemen dependent on imports for practically all of its essential needs.
Once self-sufficient in food production, northern Yemen has become a major
importer. Land once used for export crops&#151;cotton, fruit, and vegetables
- has been turned over to growing a shrub called qat, whose leaves are chewed
for their stimulant effect by Yemenis and which has no significant export
market. Economic growth in former South Yemen has been constrained by a lack
of incentives, partly stemming from centralized control over production decisions,
investment allocation, and import choices. Yemen's GDP has been supplemented
by remittances from Yemenis working abroad and by foreign aid. Since the Gulf
crisis, however, remittances have dropped substantially. Floods in June 1996
caused the loss of much valuable topsoil in the agricultural sector, increasing
the need for imports of foodstuffs. Oil production and GDP as a whole are
expected to increase moderately in 1998.
