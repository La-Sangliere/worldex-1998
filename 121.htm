<p>
<b>Climate:</b> mostly desert; mild to cool winters with dry, hot, cloudless summers;

<p>
<b>Economy&#151;overview:</b> The Ba'thist regime engages in extensive central planning and management
of industrial production and foreign trade while leaving some small-scale
industry and services and most agriculture to private enterprise. The economy
has been dominated by the oil sector, which has traditionally provided about
95% of foreign exchange earnings. In the 1980s, financial problems caused
by massive expenditures in the eight-year war with Iran and damage to oil
export facilities by Iran led the government to implement austerity measures
and to borrow heavily and later reschedule foreign debt payments; Iraq suffered
economic losses of at least $100 billion from the war. After the end of hostilities
in 1988, oil exports gradually increased with the construction of new pipelines
and restoration of damaged facilities. Agricultural development remained hampered
by labor shortages, salinization, and dislocations caused by previous land
reform and collectivization programs. The industrial sector, although accorded
high priority by the government, also was under financial constraints. Iraq's
seizure of Kuwait in August 1990, subsequent international economic embargoes,
and military action by an international coalition beginning in January 1991
drastically changed the economic picture. The UN-sponsored economic embargo
has reduced exports and imports and has contributed to the sharp rise in prices.
The Iraqi Government has been unwilling to abide by UN resolutions so that
the economic embargo could be removed. The government's policies of supporting
large military and internal security forces and of allocating resources to
key supporters of the regime have exacerbated shortages. Industrial and transportation
facilities, which suffered severe damage, have been partially restored. At
current prices, oil exports are about one-third of their prewar level because
of the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 986&#151;the UN's oil-for-goods
program&#151;in December 1996. Shortages of spare parts continue. In accord with
the oil-for-goods deal, Iraq is allowed to export $2 billion worth of oil
in exchange for badly needed food and medicine. The first oil was pumped in
December 1996, and the first supplies of food and medicine arrived in April
1997. Per capita output for 1995-97 and living standards are well below the
1989-90 level, but any estimates have a wide range of error.

to work out written agreements settling outstanding disputes from their eight-year
war concerning border demarcation, prisoners-of-war, and freedom of navigation
and sovereignty over the Shatt al Arab waterway; in November 1994, Iraq formally
accepted the UN-demarcated border with Kuwait which had been spelled out in
Security Council Resolutions 687 (1991), 773 (1993), and 883 (1993); this
formally ends earlier claims to Kuwait and to Bubiyan and Warbah islands;
