<b>Current issues:</b> The territories occupied by Israel since the 1967 war are not included
in the data below, unless otherwise noted. In keeping with the framework established
at the Madrid Conference in October 1991, bilateral negotiations are being
conducted between Israel and Palestinian representatives, and Israel and Syria,
to achieve a permanent settlement between them. On 25 April 1982, Israel withdrew
from the Sinai pursuant to the 1979 Israel-Egypt Peace treaty. Outstanding
territorial and other disputes with Jordan were resolved in the 26 October
1994 Israel-Jordan Treaty of Peace.

under the new law, each voter casts two ballots&#151;one for the direct election
of the prime minister and one for the party in the Knesset; the candidate
that receives the largest percentage of the popular vote then works to form
a coalition with other parties to achieve a parliamentary majority of 61 seats;
finally, the candidate must submit his or her cabinet to the Knesset for approval

system, under the new law, the prime minister's party need not be the single-largest
party in the Knesset

<p>
<b>Economy&#151;overview:</b> Israel has a technologically advanced market economy with substantial
government participation. It depends on imports of crude oil, grains, raw
materials, and military equipment. Despite limited natural resources, Israel
has intensively developed its agricultural and industrial sectors over the
past 20 years. Manufacturing and construction employ about 28% of Israeli
workers; agriculture, forestry, and fishing only 2.6%; and services the rest.
Israel is largely self-sufficient in food production except for grains. Diamonds,
high-technology equipment, and agricultural products (fruits and vegetables)
are leading exports. Israel usually posts sizable current account deficits,
which are covered by large transfer payments from abroad and by foreign loans.
Roughly half of the government's external debt is owed to the US, which is
its major source of economic and military aid. To earn needed foreign exchange,
Israel has been targeting high-technology niches in international markets,
such as medical scanning equipment. The influx of Jewish immigrants from the
former USSR topped 750,000 during the period 1989-97, bringing the population
of Israel from the former Soviet Union to one million, or one-sixth of the
total population. Initially this great influx increased unemployment, intensified
housing problems, and strained the government budget. At the same time, the
immigrants bring to the economy scientific and professional expertise of substantial
value for the future.
