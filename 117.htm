<p>
<b>Economy&#151;overview:</b> India's economy encompasses traditional village farming, modern agriculture,
handicrafts, a wide range of modern industries, and a multitude of support
services. 67% of India's labor force of nearly 400 million work in agriculture,
which contributes 30% of the country's GDP. Production, trade, and investment
reforms since 1991 have provided new opportunities for Indian businesspersons
and an estimated 300 million middle class consumers. New Delhi has avoided
debt rescheduling, attracted foreign investment, and revived confidence in
India's economic prospects since 1991. Many of the country's fundamentals
- including savings rates (26% of GDP) and reserves (now about $24 billion)
- are healthy. Inflation eased to 7% in 1997, and interest rates dropped to
between 10% and 13%. Even so, the Indian Government needs to restore the early
momentum of reform, especially by continuing reductions in the extensive remaining
government regulations. Moreover, economic policy changes have not yet significantly
increased jobs or reduced the risk that international financial strains will
reemerge within the next few years. Nearly 40% of the Indian population remains
too poor to afford an adequate diet. India's exports, currency, and foreign
institutional investment were affected by the East Asian crisis in late 1997
and early 1998, but capital account controls, a low ratio of short-term debt
to reserves, and enhanced supervision of the financial sector helped insulate
it from near term balance-of-payments problems. Export growth, has been slipping
in 1996-97, averaging only about 4% to 5%&#151;a large drop from the more than
20% increases it was experiencing over the prior three years&#151;mainly because
of the fall in Asian currencies relative to the rupee. Energy, telecommunications,
and transportation shortages and the legacy of inefficient factories constrain
industrial growth which expanded only 6.7% in 1997&#151;down from more than 11%
in 1996. Growth of the agricultural sector is still fairly slow rebounding
to only 5.7% in 1997 from a fall of 0.1% in 1996. Agricultural investment
has slowed, while costly subsidies on fertilizer, food distribution, and rural
electricity remain. Nevertheless, even if a series of weak coalition governments
continue to rule in New Delhi over the next few years and are unable to push
reforms aggressively, parts of the economy that have already benefited from
deregulation will continue to grow. Indian think tanks project GDP growth
of at least 5.5% in 1998.
