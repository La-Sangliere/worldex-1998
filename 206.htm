<p>
<b>Economy&#151;overview:</b> Russia, a vast country with a wealth of natural resources, a well-educated
population, and a diverse, but declining, industrial base, continues to experience
formidable difficulties in moving from its old centrally planned economy to
a modern market economy. After seven consecutive years of contraction 1990-96
in which GDP fell by one-third, GDP grew by 0.4% in 1997, according to official
statistics. Moscow continued to make strides in its battle against inflation,
which fell to 11%, half the 1996 rate. The central government made good on
most back wages owed public-sector employees&#151;including the military&#151;although
the stock of wage arrears to employees of private enterprises remained large.
Privatization revenues increased significantly, largely on the strength of
a few high-profile tenders, such as that of telecommunications giant Svyazinvest.
On the downside, Moscow continued to struggle with a severe fiscal imbalance.
Lagging tax collections led the government to adopt a revised budget in spring
1997 that cut spending by about 20% despite protests from the legislature.
Russia's traditional trade surplus continued to contract&#151;largely because
of soft international commodity prices&#151;and Moscow's WTrO accession made
only halting progress. Although President YEL'TSIN brought in a new economic
team early in 1997, key structural reform initiatives continue to move slowly.
A revised tax code remains stuck in the Duma, while little progress is being
made on agricultural land reform. Small business development has lagged. Prospects
for a return to robust growth have been set back by the spillover from Asia's
financial turmoil, which hit Russia hard during the last quarter of 1997.
Moscow at first tried to both support the ruble and keep interest rates down,
but this policy proved unsustainable, and in early December 1997 the Central
Bank let interest rates rise sharply. As the year ended, Russian authorities
were attempting to put the best face on the financial situation, while at
the same time scaling back their previous optimistic growth projections for
1998 to 1%-2%. Because of Russia's severe macroeconomic constraints, resources
allocated to the military sector have declined sharply since the implosion
of the USSR in December 1991.

system; in 1992, only 661,000 new telephones were installed compared with
855,000 in 1991, and in 1992 the number of unsatisfied applications for telephones
reached 11,000,000; expanded access to international electronic mail service
available via Sprint network; the inadequacy of Russian telecommunications
is a severe handicap to the economy, especially with respect to international
connections
<br><i>domestic:</i> NMT-450 analog cellular telephone networks are operational and growing
in Moscow and St. Petersburg; intercity fiber-optic cable installation remains
limited
<br><i>international:</i> international traffic is inadequately handled by a system of satellites,
landlines, microwave radio relay, and outdated submarine cables; much of this
traffic passes through the international gateway switch in Moscow which carries
most of the international traffic for the other countries of the Commonwealth
of Independent States; a new Russian Intersputnik satellite will link Moscow
and St. Petersburg with Rome from whence calls will be relayed to destinations
in Europe and overseas; satellite earth stations&#151;NA Intelsat, 4 Intersputnik
(2 Atlantic Ocean region and 2 Indian Ocean region), NA Eutelsat, 1 Inmarsat
(Pacific Ocean region), and NA Orbita
