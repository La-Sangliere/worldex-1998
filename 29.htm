<p>
<b>Economy&#151;overview:</b> The Belarusian government has revived economic output since mid-1996
by pursuing a policy of rapid credit expansion, ending years of cumulative
decline. Real GDP increased by 2.6% in 1996 and the growth rate tripled in
1997. Lack of profitability and resurgent inflation&#151;which increased from
an average monthly rate of 2.8% in 1996 to 4.4% in 1997&#151;however, have kept
enterprises from making much needed capital investments. As a result, infrastructure
and equipment stocks have continued to deteriorate. Belarus has seen little
structural reform since 1995, when LUKASHENKO launched the country on the
path of "market socialism." Privatization of enterprises controlled by the
central government virtually ceased in 1996. As of May 1997, only about 10%
of all enterprises under central government control had been privatized. In
addition, LUKASHENKO has re-imposed administrative control over prices and
the national currency's exchange rate, and expanded the state's right to intervene
arbitrarily in the management of private enterprise. Lack of structural reform,
and a climate hostile to business, have inhibited foreign investment in Belarus
in 1995-97. In 1995 Belarus ranked second to last among the 15 former Soviet
republics in terms of the average amount of foreign investment it attracted
per capita. Although it moved up to 11th place in 1996, this was largely due
to inflows from Russia related to the construction of the Yamal natural gas
pipeline. Belarus's trade deficit has grown steadily over the past three years
- from 8% of total trade turnover in 1995 to 14% in the first quarter of 1997
- despite the government's efforts to promote exports and limit imports. Given
Belarus's limited fiscal reserve, a continued growth in the trade deficit
will increase vulnerability to a balance of payments crisis.
