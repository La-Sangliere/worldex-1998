<b>Current issues:</b> Serbia and Montenegro have asserted the formation of a joint independent
state, but this entity has not been formally recognized as a state by the
US; the US view is that the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY),
has dissolved and that none of the successor republics represents its continuation.

<p>
<b>Economy&#151;overview:</b> The swift collapse of the Yugoslav federation in 1991 has been followed
by highly destructive warfare, the destabilization of republic boundaries,
and the breakup of important interrepublic trade flows. Output in Serbia and
Montenegro dropped by half in 1992-93. Like the other former Yugoslav republics,
it had depended on its sister republics for large amounts of energy and manufactures.
Wide differences in climate, mineral resources, and levels of technology among
the republics accentuated this interdependence, as did the communist practice
of concentrating much industrial output in a small number of giant plants.
The breakup of many of the trade links, the sharp drop in output as industrial
plants lost suppliers and markets, and the destruction of physical assets
in the fighting all have contributed to the economic difficulties of the republics.
One singular factor in the economic situation of Serbia is the continuation
in office of a communist government that is primarily interested in political
and military mastery, not economic reform. Hyperinflation ended with the establishment
of a new currency unit in June 1993; prices have been relatively stable since
1995. Reliable statistics continue to be hard to come by, and the GDP estimate
is extremely rough. The economic boom anticipated by the government after
the suspension of UN sanctions in December 1995 has failed to materialize.
Until the government cooperates on such matters as human rights and war criminals,
it will lack full support from international financial institutions.
