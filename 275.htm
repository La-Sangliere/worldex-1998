<P>
There have been some significant changes in this edition. The country name 
Western Samoa has been changed to Samoa. The spelling of Kazakhstan 
includes the letter "h" once again; the spelling Kazakstan is no longer used. 
Introduction is a category with two entries&#151;<strong>Current issues</strong> and <strong>Historical 
perspective</strong>&#151;that appears in only a few country profiles at this time. In the future, 
this category may be added to more countries. 

<P>
<strong>Abbreviations:</strong> This information is included in <strong>Appendix A:</strong> Abbreviations, 
which includes all abbreviations and acronyms used in the Factbook, with their 
expansions.




<P>
<strong>Administrative divisions: </strong>
This entry generally gives the numbers, designatory terms, and first-order administrative divisions as approved by the US Board on Geographic Names (BGN). Changes that have been reported but not yet acted on by BGN are noted.


<P>
<strong>Age structure: </strong>
This entry provides the distribution of the population according to age. Information is included by sex and age group (0-14 years, 15-64 years, 65 years and over). The age structure of a population will affect a country's investment pattern. Countries with young populations (high percentage under age 15) need to invest more in schools, while countries with older populations (high percentage ages 65 and over) need to invest more in the health sector. The age structure can also be used to help predict potential political issues. For example, the rapid growth of a young adult population unable to find employment can lead to unrest.


<P>
<strong>Agriculture&#151;products: </strong>
This entry is a rank ordering of major crops and products starting with the most important.


<P>
<strong>Airports: </strong>
This entry gives the total number of airports. The runway(s) may be paved (concrete or asphalt surfaces) or unpaved (grass, dirt, sand, or gravel surfaces), but must be usable. Not all airports have facilities for refueling, maintenance, or air traffic control.


<P>
<strong>Airports&#151;with paved runways: </strong>

<P>
<strong>Appendixes: </strong>
This section includes <I>Factbook</I>-related material by topic.


<P>
<strong>Area: </strong>
This entry includes three subfields. <I>Total</I> area is the sum of all land and water areas delimited by international boundaries and/or coastlines. <I>Land area</I> is the aggregate of all surfaces delimited by international boundaries and/or coastlines, excluding inland water bodies (lakes, reservoirs, rivers). <I>Water area</I> is the sum of all water surfaces delimited by international boundaries and/or coastlines, including inland water bodies (lakes, reservoirs, rivers).


<P>
<strong>Area&#151;comparative: </strong>

The smaller entities are compared with Washington, DC (178 sq km, 69 sq mi) or The Mall in Washington, DC (0.59 sq km, 0.23 sq mi, 146 acres).


<P>
<strong>Birth rate: </strong>
This entry gives the average annual number of births during a year per 1,000 population at midyear; also known as crude birth rate.

<P>
<strong>Constitution: </strong>
This entry includes the dates of adoption, revisions, and major amendments.


<P>
<strong>Country map: </strong>Most versions of the <I>Factbook</I> provide a country map in color. The maps were produced from the best information available at the time of preparation. Names and/or boundaries may have changed subsequently.


<P>
<strong>Country name: </strong>
This entry includes all forms of the country's name approved by the US Board on Geographic Names (Italy is used as an example): <I>conventional long form</I> (Italian Republic), <I>conventional short form</I> (Italy), local long form (Repubblica Italiana), local short form (Italia), <I>former</I> (Kingdom of Italy), as well as the <I>abbreviation</I>. Also see the <B>Terminology</B> note.


<P>
<strong>Currency: </strong>
This entry identifies the national medium of exchange and its basic subunit.


<P>
<strong>Current issues: </strong>
This entry at the beginning of a country profile briefly characterizes major geographic, social, political, and military developments in the past 12 months and may include a statement about one or two key future trends. This entry appears for only a few countries at the present time, but may be added to more countries in the future.


<P>
<strong>Data code: </strong>
This entry gives the official US Government digraph that precisely identifies every land entity without overlap, duplication, or omission. AF, for example, is the data code for Afghanistan. This two-letter country code is a standardized geopolitical data element promulgated in the <I>Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS) 10-4</I> by the National Institute of Standards and Technology at the US Department of Commerce and maintained by the Office of the Geographer and Global Issues at the US Department of State. The data code is used to eliminate confusion and incompatibility in the collection, processing, and dissemination of area-specific data and is particularly useful for interchanging data between databases. <B>Appendix F</B> cross-references various country codes and <B>Appendix G</B> does the same thing for hydrographic codes.


<P>
<strong>Data codes&#151;country: </strong>
This information is presented in <B>Appendix F: Cross-Reference List of Country Data Codes</B> which includes the US Government approved Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) codes, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) codes, and Internet codes for land entities.


<P>
<strong>Data codes&#151;hydrographic: </strong>
This information is presented in <B>Appendix G: Cross-Reference List of Hydrographic Data Codes</B> which includes the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) codes, Aeronautical Chart and Information Center (ACIC; now National Imagery and Mapping Agency or NIMA) codes, and Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) codes for hydrographic entities. The US Government has not yet approved a standard for hydrographic data codes similar to the FIPS 10-4 standard for country data codes.


<P>
<strong>Dates of information: </strong>
The information cutoff date was 1 January 1998, although a few important changes after that date have been included. Most demographic statistics are estimates for 1998.


<P>
<strong>Death rate: </strong>
This entry gives the average annual number of deaths during a year per l,000 population at midyear; also known as crude death rate. The death rate, while only a rough indicator of the mortality situation in a country, accurately indicates the current mortality impact on population growth. This indicator is significantly affected by age distribution, and most countries will eventually show a rise in the overall death rate, in spite of continued decline in mortality at all ages, as declining fertility results in an aging population.


<P>
<strong>Debt&#151;external: </strong>
This entry gives the total amount of public foreign financial obligations.


<P>
<strong>Dependency status: </strong>
This entry describes the formal relationship between a particular nonindependent entity and an independent state.


<P>
<strong>Dependent areas: </strong>
This entry contains an alphabetical listing of all nonindependent entities associated in some way with a particular independent state.


<P>
<strong>Diplomatic representation: </strong>
The US Government has diplomatic relations with 184 independent states, including 178 of the 185 UN members (excluded UN members are Bhutan, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, former Yugoslavia, and the US itself). In addition, the US has diplomatic relations with 6 independent states that are not in the UN-Holy See, Kiribati, Nauru, Switzerland, Tonga, and Tuvalu.


<P>
<strong>Diplomatic representation from the US: </strong>

<P>
<strong>Disputes&#151;international: </strong>
This entry includes a wide variety of situations that range from traditional bilateral boundary disputes to unilateral claims of one sort or another. Information regarding disputes over international terrestrial and maritime boundaries has been reviewed by the US Department of State. References to other situations involving borders or frontiers may also be included, such as resource disputes, geopolitical questions, or irredentist issues; however, inclusion does not necessarily constitute official acceptance or recognition by the US Government.


<P>
<strong>Economic aid: </strong>
This entry refers to bilateral commitments of official development assistance (ODA) and other official flows (OOF). ODA is defined as financial assistance, which is concessional in character, has the main objective to promote economic development and welfare of LDCs, and contains a grant element of at least 25%. OOF transactions are also official government assistance, but with a main objective other than economic development and with a grant element less than 25%. OOF transactions include official export credits (such as Ex-Im Bank credits), official equity and portfolio investment, and debt reorganization by the official sector that does not meet concessional terms. Aid is considered to have been committed when agreements are initialed by the parties involved and constitute a formal declaration of intent. The entry is separated into two components&#151;<I>donor and recipient.</I>


<P>
<strong>Economy: </strong>
This category includes the entries dealing with the size, development, and management of productive resources, i.e., land, labor, and capital.


<P>
<strong>Economy&#151;overview: </strong>
This entry briefly describes the type of economy, including the degree of market orientation, the level of economic development, the most important natural resources, and the unique areas of specialization. It also characterizes major economic events and policy changes in the most recent 12 months and may include a statement about one or two key future macroeconomic trends.


<P>

This entry gives the maximum designed potential for electricity production expressed in kilowatts.


<P>
<strong>Electricity&#151;consumption per capita: </strong>
This entry gives the figure for annual electricity generation plus imports, minus exports, and divided by total population for the same year expressed in kilowatt hours.


<P>
<strong>Electricity&#151;production: </strong>
This entry gives the annual amount of electricity actually generated expressed in kilowatt hours.


<P>

This entry includes both the <I>highest point</I> and the <I>lowest point.</I>


<P>
<strong>Entities: </strong>
Some of the independent states, dependencies, areas of special sovereignty, and governments included in this publication are not independent, and others are not officially recognized by the US Government. "Independent state" refers to a people politically organized into a sovereign state with a definite territory. "Dependencies" and "areas of special sovereignty" refer to a broad category of political entities that are associated in some way with an independent state. "Country" names used in the table of contents or for page headings are usually the short-form names as approved by the US Board on Geographic Names and may include independent states, dependencies, and areas of special sovereignty, or other geographic entities. There are a total of 266 separate geographic entities in <I>The World Factbook</I> that may be categorized as follows:

<P>
<strong>GDP: </strong>
This entry gives the gross domestic product (GDP) or value of all final goods and services produced within a nation in a given year. GDP dollar estimates in the Factbook are derived from purchasing power parity (PPP) calculations. See the note on <B>GDP methodology</B> for more information.


<P>
<strong>GDP methodology: </strong>
In the <B>Economy</B> section, GDP dollar estimates for all countries are derived from purchasing power parity (PPP) calculations rather than from conversions at official currency exchange rates. The PPP method involves the use of standardized international dollar price weights, which are applied to the quantities of final goods and services produced in a given economy.  The data derived from the PPP method provide a better comparison of economic well-being between countries.  The division of a GDP estimate in domestic currency by the corresponding PPP estimate in dollars gives the PPP conversion rate.  When converted at PPP rates, $1,000 will buy the same market basket of goods in any country.  Whereas PPP estimates for OECD countries are quite reliable, PPP estimates for developing countries are often rough approximations.  Most of the GDP estimates are based on extrapolation of PPP numbers published by the UN International Comparison Program (UNICP) and by Professors Robert Summers and Alan Heston of the University of Pennsylvania and their colleagues. In contrast, currency exchange rates depend on a variety of international and domestic financial forces that often have little relation to domestic output. In developing countries with weak currencies the exchange rate estimate of GDP in dollars is typically one-fourth to one-half the PPP estimate. Furthermore, exchange rates may suddenly go up or down by 10% or more because of market forces or official fiat whereas real output has remained unchanged. On 12 January 1994, for example, the 14 countries of the African Financial Community (whose currencies are tied to the French franc) devalued their currencies by 50%. This move, of course, did not cut the real output of these countries by half. One important caution: the proportion of, say, defense expenditures as a percentage of GDP in local currency accounts may differ substantially from the proportion when GDP accounts are expressed in PPP terms, as, for example, when an observer tries to estimate the dollar level of Russian or Japanese military expenditures. 
<BR>Note: the numbers for GDP and other economic data can <I>not</I> be chained together from successive volumes of the <I>Factbook</I> because of changes in the US dollar measuring rod, revisions of data by statistical agencies, use of new or different sources of information, and changes in national statistical methods and practices.  For statistical series on GDP and other economic variables, see the <I>Handbook of International Economic Statistics</I> available from the same sources as <I>The World Factbook.</I>

<strong>Merchant marine: </strong>
Merchant marine may be defined as all ships engaged in the carriage of goods; all commercial vessels (as opposed to all nonmilitary ships), which excludes tugs, fishing vessels, offshore oil rigs, etc.; or a grouping of merchant ships by nationality or register. This entry contains information in two subfields&#151;<I>total and ships by type. Total</I> includes the total number of ships (1,000 GRT or over), total DWT for those ships, and total GRT for those ships. <I>Ships by type</I> includes a listing of barge carriers, bulk cargo ships, cargo ships, combination bulk carriers, combination ore/oil carriers, container ships, intermodal ships, liquefied gas tankers, livestock carriers, multifunction large-load carriers, oil tankers, passenger ships, passenger-cargo ships, railcar carriers, refrigerated cargo ships, roll-on/roll-off cargo ships, short-sea passenger ships, specialized tankers, tanker tug-barges, and vehicle carriers.  
<BR>
<img src="816.gif">A captive register is a register of ships maintained by a territory, possession, or colony primarily or exclusively for the use of ships owned in the parent country; it is also referred to as an offshore register, the offshore equivalent of an internal register. Ships on a captive register will fly the same flag as the parent country, or a local variant of it, but will be subject to the maritime laws and taxation rules of the offshore territory. Although the nature of a captive register makes it especially desirable for ships owned in the parent country, just as in the internal register, the ships may also be owned abroad. The captive register then acts as a flag of convenience register, except that it is not the register of an independent state.

<BR>
<img src="816.gif">A flag of convenience register is a national register offering registration to a merchant ship not owned in the flag state. The major flags of convenience (FOC) attract ships to their registers by virtue of low fees, low or nonexistent taxation of profits, and liberal manning requirements. True FOC registers are characterized by having relatively few of the registered ships actually owned in the flag state. Thus, while virtually any flag can be used for ships under a given set of circumstances, an FOC register is one where the majority of the merchant fleet is owned abroad. It is also referred to as an open register.


<BR><img src="816.gif">A flag state is the nation in which a ship is registered and which holds legal jurisdiction over operation of the ship, whether at home or abroad. Maritime legislation of the flag state determines how a ship is crewed and taxed and whether a foreign-owned ship may be placed on the register. 
<BR>
An internal register is a register of ships maintained as a subset of a national register. Ships on the internal register fly the national flag and have that nationality but are subject to a separate set of maritime rules from those on the main national register. These differences usually include lower taxation of profits, use of foreign nationals as crew members, and, usually, ownership outside the flag state (when it functions as an FOC register). The Norwegian International Ship Register and Danish International Ship Register are the most notable examples of an internal register. Both have been instrumental in stemming flight from the national flag to flags of convenience and in attracting foreign-owned ships to the Norwegian and Danish flags.


<BR><img src="816.gif">A merchant ship is a vessel that carries goods against payment of freight; it is commonly used to denote any nonmilitary ship but accurately restricted to commercial vessels only.


<BR><img src="816.gif">A register is the record of a ship's ownership and nationality as listed with the maritime authorities of a country; also, it is the compendium of such individual ships' registrations. Registration of a ship provides it with a nationality and makes it subject to the laws of the country in which registered (the flag state) regardless of the nationality of the ship's ultimate owner.

<strong>Net migration rate: </strong>
This entry includes the figure for the difference between the number of persons entering and leaving a country during the year per 1,000 persons (based on midyear population). An excess of persons entering the country is referred to as net immigration (e.g., 3.56 migrants/1,000 population); an excess of persons leaving the country as net emigration (e.g., -9.26 migrants/1,000 population). The net migration rate indicates the contribution of migration to the overall level of population change. High levels of migration can cause problems such as increasing unemployment and potential ethnic strife (if people are coming in) or reducing the labor force, perhaps in certain key sectors (if people are leaving).

The total population presents one overall measure of the potential impact of the country on the world and within its region. Note: starting with the 1993 <I>Factbook</I>, demographic estimates for some countries (mostly African) have taken into account the effects of the growing incidence of AIDS infections. In 1998 these countries are Botswana, Brazil, Burkina Faso, Burma, Burundi, Cambodia, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Republic of the Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Thailand, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.


<P>
<strong>Population growth rate: </strong>
The average annual percent change in the population, resulting from a surplus (or deficit) of births over deaths and the balance of migrants entering and leaving a country. The rate may be positive or negative. Also known as growth rate or average annual rate of growth. The growth rate is a factor in determining how great a burden would be imposed on a country by the changing needs of its people for infrastructure (e.g., schools, hospitals, housing, roads), resources (e.g., food, water, electricity), and jobs. Rapid population growth can be seen as threatening by neighboring countries.


<P>
<strong>Ports and harbors: </strong>

<strong>Sex ratio: </strong>
This entry includes the number of males for each female in five age groups&#151;<I>at birth, under 15 years, 15-64 years, 65 years and over, and for the total population.</I> Sex ratio at birth has recently emerged as an indicator of certain kinds of sex discrimination in some countries. For instance, high sex ratios at birth in some Asian countries are now attributed to sex-selective abortion and infanticide due to a strong preference for sons. This will affect future marriage patterns and fertility patterns. Eventually it could cause unrest among young adult males who are unable to find partners.  The sex ratio at birth for the World is 1.06 (1998 est.).

<strong>Total fertility rate: </strong>
This entry gives a figure for the average number of children that would be born per woman if all women lived to the end of their childbearing years and bore children according to a given fertility rate at each age. The total fertility rate is a more direct measure of the level of fertility than the crude birth rate, since it refers to births per woman. This indicator shows the potential for population growth in the country. High rates will also place some limits on the labor force participation rates for women. Large numbers of children born to women indicate large family sizes that might limit the capacity of the families to educate their children.
