<b>Current issues:</b> On 21 November 1995, in Dayton, Ohio, the former Yugoslavia's three
warring parties signed a peace agreement that brought to a halt over three
years of interethnic civil strife in Bosnia and Herzegovina (the final agreement
was signed in Paris on 14 December 1995). The Dayton Agreement, signed then
by Bosnian President IZETBEGOVIC, Croatian President TUDJMAN, and Serbian
President MILOSEVIC, divides Bosnia and Herzegovina roughly equally between
the Muslim/Croat Federation and the Bosnian Serbs while maintaining Bosnia's
currently recognized borders. In 1995-96, a NATO-led international peacekeeping
force (IFOR) of 60,000 troops served in Bosnia to implement and monitor the
military aspects of the agreement. IFOR was succeeded by a smaller, NATO-led
Stabilization Force (SFOR) whose mission is to deter renewed hostilities.
SFOR will remain in place until June 1998. A High Representative appointed
by the UN Security Council is responsible for civilian implementation of the
accord, including monitoring implementation, facilitating any difficulties
arising in connection with civilian implementation, and coordinating activities
of the civilian organizations and agencies in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The
Bosnian conflict began in the spring of 1992 when the government of Bosnia
and Herzegovina held a referendum on independence and the Bosnian Serbs -
supported by neighboring Serbia&#151;responded with armed resistance aimed at
partitioning the republic along ethnic lines and joining Serb-held areas to
form a "greater Serbia." In March 1994, Bosnia's Muslims and Croats reduced
the number of warring factions from three to two by signing an agreement in
Washington creating their joint Muslim/Croat Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The Federation, formed by the Muslims and Croats in March 1994, is one of
two entities (the other being the Bosnian Serb-led Republika Srpska) that
comprise Bosnia and Herzegovina.

<b>Government&#151;note:</b> Until declaring independence in spring 1992, Bosnia and Herzegovina
existed as a republic in the former Yugoslavia. Bosnia was partitioned by
fighting during 1992-95 and governed by competing ethnic factions. Bosnia's
current governing structures were created by the Dayton Accords, the 1995
peace agreement which was officially signed in Paris on 14 December 1995 by
Bosnian President IZETBEGOVIC, Croatian President TUDJMAN, and Serbian President
MILOSEVIC. This agreement retained Bosnia's exterior border and created a
joint multi-ethnic and democratic government. This national government&#151;based
on proportional representation similar to that which existed in the former
socialist regime&#151;is charged with conducting foreign, economic, and fiscal
policy. The Dayton Accords also recognized a second tier of government, comprised
of two entities&#151;a joint Muslim/Croat Federation and the Bosnian Serb Republika
Srpska (RS)&#151;each presiding over roughly one-half the territory. The Federation
and RS governments are charged with overseeing internal functions. As mandated
by the Dayton Accords, the Bosnians on 14 September 1996 participated in the
first post-war elections of national, entity, and cantonal leaders. The Bosnians
have been slow to form and install new joint institutions. A new Federation
cabinet was sworn in 18 December 1996 and the new Bosnian central government
cabinet was confirmed on 3 January 1997. The Bosnians on 13-14 September 1997
participated in municipal elections, postponed in 1996 because of voter registration
irregularities.

<b>Economy&#151;overview:</b> Bosnia and Herzegovina ranked next to The Former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia as the poorest republic in the old Yugoslav federation. Although
agriculture has been almost all in private hands, farms have been small and
inefficient, and the republic traditionally has been a net importer of food.
Industry has been greatly overstaffed, one reflection of the rigidities of
communist central planning and management. TITO had pushed the development
of military industries in the republic with the result that Bosnia hosted
a large share of Yugoslavia's defense plants. The bitter interethnic warfare
in Bosnia caused production to plummet by 80% from 1990 to 1995, unemployment
to soar, and human misery to multiply. With an uneasy peace in place, output
has recovered in 1996-97 at high percentage rates on a low base, but remains
less than half the 1990 level. The country, especially in the Muslim-Croat
area, receives substantial amounts of humanitarian aid from the international
community. Wide regional differences in war damage and access to the outside
world have resulted in substantial variations in living conditions among local
areas and individual families.
