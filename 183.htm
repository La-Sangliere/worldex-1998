<b>Economy&#151;overview:</b> The oil-rich Nigerian economy continues to be hobbled by political instability,
corruption, and poor macroeconomic management. Nigeria's unpopular military
rulers have failed to make significant progress in diversifying the economy
away from overdependence on the capital intensive oil sector which provides
30% of GDP, 95% of foreign exchange earnings, and about 80% of budgetary revenues.
The government's resistance to initiating greater transparency and accountability
in managing the country's multibillion dollar oil earnings continues to limit
economic growth and prevent an agreement with the IMF and bilateral creditors
on debt relief. The largely subsistence agricultural sector has failed to
keep up with rapid population growth, and Nigeria, once a large net exporter
of food, now must import food. Agricultural production in 1996 suffered from
severe shortages of fertilizer, and production of fertilizer fell even further
in 1997.
