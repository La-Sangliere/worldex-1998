<p>
<b>Economy&#151;overview:</b> Vietnam is a poor, densely populated country that has had to recover
from the ravages of war, the loss of financial support from the old Soviet
Bloc, and the rigidities of a centrally planned economy. Substantial progress
has been achieved over the past 10 years in moving forward from an extremely
low starting point. Economic growth continued at a strong pace during 1997
with industrial output rising by 12% and real GDP expanding by 8.5%. These
positive numbers, however, masked some major difficulties that are emerging
in economic performance. Many domestic industries, including coal, cement,
steel, and paper, reported large stockpiles of inventory and tough competition
from more efficient foreign producers, giving Vietnam a trade deficit of $3.3
billion in 1997. While disbursements of aid and foreign direct investment
have risen, they are not large enough to finance the rapid increase in imports;
and it is widely believed that Vietnam may be using short-term trade credits
to bridge the gap&#151;a risky strategy that could result in a foreign exchange
crunch. Meanwhile, Vietnamese authorities continue to move slowly toward implementing
the structural reforms needed to revitalize the economy and produce more competitive,
export-driven industries. Privatization of state enterprises remains bogged
down in political controversy, while the country's dynamic private sector
is denied both financing and access to markets. Reform of the banking sector
is proceeding slowly, raising concerns that the country will be unable to
tap sufficient domestic savings to maintain current high levels of growth.
Administrative and legal barriers are also causing costly delays for foreign
investors and are raising similar doubts about Vietnam's ability to maintain
the inflow of foreign capital. Ideological bias in favor of state intervention
and control of the economy is slowing progress toward a more liberalized investment
environment.

<b>Telephone system:</b> while Vietnam's telecommunication sector lags far behind other countries
in Southeast Asia, Hanoi has made considerable progress since 1991 in upgrading
the system; Vietnam has digitized all provincial switch boards, while fiber-optic

and Ho Chi Minh City to all provinces; the density of telephone receivers
nationwide doubled from 1993 to 1995, but is still far behind other countries
in the region; Vietnam's telecommunications strategy aims to increase telephone
density to 30 per 1,000 inhabitants by the year 2000 and authorities estimate
that approximately $2.7 billion will be spent on telecommunications upgrades
