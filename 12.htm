<b>Location:</b> continent mostly south of the Antarctic Circle

<p>
<b>Geographic coordinates:</b> 90 00 S, 0 00 E 

<p>
<b>Map references:</b> Antarctic Region 

<p>
<b>Area:</b> 
<br><i>total:</i> 14 million sq km 
<br><i>land:</i> 14 million sq km (280,000 sq km ice-free, 13.72 million sq km ice-covered)
(est.)
<br><i>note:</i> second-smallest continent (after Australia)

<p>
<b>Area&#151;comparative:</b> slightly less than 1.5 times the size of the US

<p>
<b>Land boundaries:</b> 0 km 
<br><i>note:</i> see entry on International disputes

<p>
<b>Coastline:</b> 17,968 km 

<p>
<b>Maritime claims:</b> none, but see entry on International disputes

<p>
<b>Climate:</b> severe low temperatures vary with latitude, elevation, and distance
from the ocean; East Antarctica is colder than West Antarctica because of
its higher elevation; Antarctic Peninsula has the most moderate climate; higher
temperatures occur in January along the coast and average slightly below freezing


<p>
<b>Terrain:</b> about 98% thick continental ice sheet and 2% barren rock, with average
elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters; mountain ranges up to about 5,000
meters; ice-free coastal areas include parts of southern Victoria Land, Wilkes
Land, the Antarctic Peninsula area, and parts of Ross Island on McMurdo Sound;
glaciers form ice shelves along about half of the coastline, and floating
ice shelves constitute 11% of the area of the continent

<p>
<b>Elevation extremes:</b> 
<br><i>lowest point:</i> Indian Ocean 0 m 
<br><i>highest point:</i> Vinson Massif 5,140 m 

<p>
<b>Natural resources:</b> none presently exploited; iron ore, chromium, copper, gold, nickel,
platinum and other minerals, and coal and hydrocarbons have been found in
small, uncommercial quantities 

<p>
<b>Land use:</b> 
<br><i>arable land:</i> 0% 
<br><i>permanent crops:</i> 0% 
<br><i>permanent pastures:</i> 0% 
<br><i>forests and woodland:</i> 0% 
<br><i>other:</i> 100% (ice 98%, barren rock 2%)

<p>
<b>Irrigated land:</b> 0 sq km (1993)

<p>
<b>Natural hazards:</b> katabatic (gravity-driven) winds blow coastward from the high interior;
frequent blizzards form near the foot of the plateau; cyclonic storms form
over the ocean and move clockwise along the coast; volcanism on Deception
Island and isolated areas of West Antarctica; other seismic activity rare
and weak

<p>
<b>Environment&#151;current issues:</b> in 1995 it was reported that the ozone shield, which protects the Earth's
surface from harmful ultraviolet radiation, had dwindled to the lowest level
recorded over Antarctica since 1975 when measurements were first taken

<p>
<b>Environment&#151;international agreements:</b> 
<br><i>party to:</i> none of the selected agreements
<br><i>signed, but not ratified:</i> none of the selected agreements

<p>
<b>Geography&#151;note:</b> the coldest, windiest, highest, and driest continent; during summer,
more solar radiation reaches the surface at the South Pole than is received
at the Equator in an equivalent period; mostly uninhabitable

<b>Government type:</b> Antarctic Treaty Summary&#151;The Antarctic Treaty, signed on 1 December
1959 and entered into force on 23 June 1961, establishes the legal framework
for the management of Antarctica. Administration is carried out through consultative
member meetings&#151;the 18th Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting was in Japan
in April 1993. Currently, there are 42 treaty member nations: 26 consultative
and 16 acceding. Consultative (voting) members include the seven nations that
claim portions of Antarctica as national territory (some claims overlap) and
19 nonclaimant nations. The US and some other nations that have made no claims
have reserved the right to do so. The US does not recognize the claims of
others. The year in parentheses indicates when an acceding nation was voted
to full consultative (voting) status, while no date indicates the country
was an original 1959 treaty signatory. Claimant nations are&#151;Argentina, Australia,
Chile, France, New Zealand, Norway, and the UK. Nonclaimant consultative nations
are&#151;Belgium, Brazil (1983), China (1985), Ecuador (1990), Finland (1989),
Germany (1981), India (1983), Italy (1987), Japan, South Korea (1989), Netherlands
(1990), Peru (1989), Poland (1977), South Africa, Spain (1988), Sweden (1988),
Uruguay (1985), the US, and Russia. Acceding (nonvoting) members, with year
of accession in parentheses, are&#151;Austria (1987), Bulgaria (1978), Canada
(1988), Colombia (1988), Cuba (1984), Czech Republic (1993), Denmark (1965),
Greece (1987), Guatemala (1991), Hungary (1984), North Korea (1987), Papua
New Guinea (1981), Romania (1971), Slovakia (1993), Switzerland (1990), and
Ukraine (1992). Article 1&#151;area to be used for peaceful purposes only; military
activity, such as weapons testing, is prohibited, but military personnel and
equipment may be used for scientific research or any other peaceful purpose;
Article 2&#151;freedom of scientific investigation and cooperation shall continue;
Article 3&#151;free exchange of information and personnel in cooperation with
the UN and other international agencies; Article 4&#151;does not recognize, dispute,
or establish territorial claims and no new claims shall be asserted while
the treaty is in force; Article 5&#151;prohibits nuclear explosions or disposal
of radioactive wastes; Article 6&#151;includes under the treaty all land and
ice shelves south of 60 degrees 00 minutes south; Article 7&#151;treaty-state
observers have free access, including aerial observation, to any area and
may inspect all stations, installations, and equipment; advance notice of
all activities and of the introduction of military personnel must be given;
Article 8&#151;allows for jurisdiction over observers and scientists by their
own states; Article 9&#151;frequent consultative meetings take place among member
nations; Article 10&#151;treaty states will discourage activities by any country
in Antarctica that are contrary to the treaty; Article 11&#151;disputes to be
settled peacefully by the parties concerned or, ultimately, by the ICJ; Articles
12, 13, 14&#151;deal with upholding, interpreting, and amending the treaty among
involved nations;  other agreements&#151;more than 170 recommendations adopted
at treaty consultative meetings and ratified by governments include&#151;Agreed
Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora (1964); Convention
for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals (1972); Convention on the Conservation
of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (1980); a mineral resources agreement
was signed in 1988 but was subsequently rejected; the Protocol on Environmental
Protection to the Antarctic Treaty was signed 4 October 1991 and entered into
force 14 January 1998; this agreement provides for the protection of the Antarctic
environment through five specific annexes on marine pollution, fauna, and
flora, environmental impact assessments, waste management, and protected areas;
it also prohibits all activities relating to mineral resources except scientific
research; 27 parties have ratified the Protocol as of April 1998

<p>
<b>Legal system:</b> US law, including certain criminal offenses by or against US nationals,
such as murder, may apply to areas not under jurisdiction of other countries.
Some US laws directly apply to Antarctica. For example, the Antarctic Conservation
Act, 16 U.S.C. section 2401 et seq., provides civil and criminal penalties
for the following activities, unless authorized by regulation of statute:
the taking of native mammals or birds; the introduction of nonindigenous plants
and animals; entry into specially protected or scientific areas; the discharge
or disposal of pollutants; and the importation into the US of certain items
from Antarctica. Violation of the Antarctic Conservation Act carries penalties
of up to $10,000 in fines and one year in prison. The Departments of Treasury,
Commerce, Transportation, and Interior share enforcement responsibilities.
Public Law 95-541, the US Antarctic Conservation Act of 1978, requires expeditions
from the US to Antarctica to notify, in advance, the Office of Oceans and
Polar Affairs, Room 5801, Department of State, Washington, DC 20520, which
reports such plans to other nations as required by the Antarctic Treaty. For
more information, contact Permit Office, Office of Polar Programs, National
Science Foundation, Arlington, Virginia 22230 (703) 306-1031.
