<p>
<b>Economy&#151;overview:</b> The US has the most powerful, diverse, and technologically advanced
economy in the world, with a per capita GDP of $30,200, the largest among
major industrial nations. In this market-oriented economy, private individuals
and business firms make most of the decisions, and government buys needed
goods and services predominantly in the private marketplace. US business firms
enjoy considerably greater flexibility than their counterparts in Western
Europe and Japan in decisions to expand capital plant, lay off surplus workers,
and develop new products. At the same time, they face higher barriers to entry
in their rivals' home markets than the barriers to entry of foreign firms
in US markets. In all economic sectors, US firms are at or near the forefront
in technological advances, especially in computers and in medical, aerospace,
and military equipment, although their advantage has narrowed since the end
of World War II. The onrush of technology largely explains the gradual development
of a "two-tier labor market" in which those at the bottom lack the education
and the professional/technical skills of those at the top and, more and more,
fail to get pay raises, health insurance coverage, and other benefits. The
years 1994-97 witnessed moderate gains in real output, low inflation rates,
and a drop in unemployment below 6%. Long-term problems include inadequate
investment in economic infrastructure, rapidly rising medical costs of an
aging population, sizable trade deficits, and stagnation of family income
in the lower economic groups. The outlook for 1998 is for continued moderate
growth, low inflation, and about the same level of unemployment. Two shadows
for 1998 are the severe financial crises in East Asia and the exuberant level
of stock prices in relation to corporate earnings.
