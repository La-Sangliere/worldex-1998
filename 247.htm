<p>
<b>Economy&#151;overview:</b> Turkey's dynamic economy is a complex mix of modern industry and commerce
along with traditional village agriculture and crafts. It has a strong and
rapidly growing private sector, yet the state still plays a major role in
basic industry, banking, transport, and communication. Its most important
industry&#151;and the largest source of exports&#151;is textiles and clothing, which
is almost entirely in private hands. The current economic situation is marked
by strong growth coupled with serious imbalances. Real GDP expanded by about
7% in 1997 but inflation rose to 99% at yearend, and the public sector fiscal
deficit probably remained near 10% of GDP. To some extent, Ankara is caught
in a vicious fiscal circle because about half of all central government revenue
is going to pay interest on the national debt. The government that took office
in July 1997&#151;headed by Prime Minister YILMAZ's Motherland Party&#151;enacted
a 1998 budget that includes substantial tax increases and cuts in non-interest
spending but these gains will be offset by a jump in interest payments. The
government also is planning to overhaul the social welfare and tax systems
and to speed up privatization, although these reforms will face tough political
opposition. Ankara is trying to increase trade with other countries in the
region but most of Turkey's trade is still with OECD countries. Despite the
implementation in January 1996 of customs union with the EU, foreign direct
investment in the country remains low&#151;about $0.5 billion annually&#151;perhaps
because potential investors are concerned about high inflation and the unsettled
political situation. Economic growth will slow in 1998 to perhaps 4%, and
inflation should decline, although the government's 50% target appears overoptimistic.
The current account deficit probably will remain small&#151;1% to 1.5% of GDP
- when Turkey's unrecorded "suitcase" exports are included.
