<p>
<b>Economy&#151;overview:</b> Taiwan has a dynamic capitalist economy with gradually decreasing guidance
of investment and foreign trade by government authorities and partial government
ownership of some large banks and industrial firms. Spillover from the Asian
financial crisis hit Taiwan in the fourth quarter of 1997, wreaking havoc
on the stock and currency markets. While the economy remains sound (the government
forecasts 6% GDP growth for 1998), the New Taiwan Dollar depreciated 20% in
1997. Real growth in GDP has averaged about 8.5% a year during the past three
decades. Export growth has been even faster and has provided the impetus for
industrialization. Inflation and unemployment are low. Agriculture contributes
only 3% to GDP, down from 35% in 1952. Traditional labor-intensive industries
are steadily being moved off-shore and replaced with more capital- and technology-intensive
industries. Taiwan has become a major investor in China, Thailand, Indonesia,
the Philippines, Malaysia, and Vietnam. The tightening of labor markets has
led to an influx of foreign workers, both legal and illegal.
