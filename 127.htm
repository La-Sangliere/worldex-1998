<p>
<b>Economy&#151;overview:</b> Government-industry cooperation, a strong work ethic, mastery of high
technology, and a comparatively small defense allocation (roughly 1% of GDP)
have helped Japan advance with extraordinary rapidity to the rank of second
most powerful economy in the world. One notable characteristic of the economy
is the working together of manufacturers, suppliers, and distributors in closely
knit groups called keiretsu. A second basic feature has been the guarantee
of lifetime employment for a substantial portion of the urban labor force;
this guarantee is eroding. Industry, the most important sector of the economy,
is heavily dependent on imported raw materials and fuels. The much smaller
agricultural sector is highly subsidized and protected, with crop yields among
the highest in the world. Usually self-sufficient in rice, Japan must import
about 50% of its requirements of other grain and fodder crops. Japan maintains
one of the world's largest fishing fleets and accounts for nearly 15% of the
global catch. For three decades overall real economic growth had been spectacular:
a 10% average in the 1960s, a 5% average in the 1970s, and a 4% average in
the 1980s. Growth slowed markedly in 1992-95 largely because of the aftereffects
of overinvestment during the late 1980s and contractionary domestic policies
intended to wring speculative excesses from the stock and real estate markets.
Growth picked up to 3.9% in 1996, largely a reflection of stimulative fiscal
and monetary policies as well as low rates of inflation. But in 1997 growth
fell back to 1%. As a result of the expansionary fiscal policies and declining
tax revenues due to the recession, Japan has one of the largest budget deficits
as a percent of GDP among the industrialized countries. The crowding of habitable
land area and the aging of the population are two other major long-run problems.
