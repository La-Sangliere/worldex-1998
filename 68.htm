<p>
<b>Economy&#151;overview:</b> The state plays the primary role in the economy and controls practically
all foreign trade. The government has undertaken several reforms in recent
years to stem excess liquidity, increase labor incentives, and alleviate serious
shortages of food, consumer goods, and services. The liberalized agricultural
markets introduced in October 1994, at which state and private farmers sell
above-quota production at unrestricted prices, have broadened legal consumption
alternatives and reduced black market prices. Government efforts to lower
subsidies to unprofitable enterprises and to shrink the money supply caused
the semi-official exchange rate for the Cuban peso to move from a peak of
120 to the dollar in the summer of 1994 to 23 to the dollar by yearend 1997.
New taxes introduced in 1996 helped drive down the number of self-employed
workers from 208,000 in January 1996 to 176,000 by September 1997. Havana
announced in 1995 that GDP declined by 35% during 1989-93, the result of lost
Soviet aid and domestic inefficiencies. The drop in GDP apparently halted
in 1994, when Cuba reported 0.7% growth, followed by increases of 2.5% in
1995 and 7.8% in 1996. Growth slowed again in 1997, to 2.5%, in part due to
a poor sugar harvest. Export earnings declined 3% in 1997, to $1.9 billion,
the result of lower sugar export volume and lower world prices for nickel
and sugar. Imports remained unchanged in 1997 at $3.2 billion. Tourism plays
a key role in foreign currency earnings. The disparity between those at the
top of the ladder and those at the bottom has increased markedly in the past
10 years. Living standards for the average Cuban remain at a depressed level
compared with 1990.
