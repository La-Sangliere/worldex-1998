<p>
<b>Economy&#151;overview:</b> More than 90% of this command economy is socialized; agricultural land
is collectivized; and state-owned industry produces 95% of manufactured goods.
State control of economic affairs is unusually tight even for a communist
country because of the small size and homogeneity of the society and the strict
rule of KIM Il-song in the past and now his son, KIM Chong-il. Economic growth
during the period 1984-88 averaged 2%-3%, but output declined by an average
of 4%-5% or more annually during 1989-97 because of systemic problems and
disruptions in economic and technological links with the former USSR and China.
The leadership has insisted on maintaining its high level of military outlays
from a shrinking economic pie. Moreover, a serious drawdown in inventories
and critical shortages in the energy sector have led to increasing interruptions
in industrial production. Abundant mineral resources and hydropower have formed
the basis of industrial development since World War II. Manufacturing is centered
on heavy industry, including military industry, with light industry lagging
far behind. Despite the use of improved seed varieties, expansion of irrigation,
and the heavy use of fertilizers, North Korea is not yet self-sufficient in
food production. Indeed, a shortage of arable lands, several years of poor
harvests, systemic inefficiencies, a cumbersome distribution system, and extensive
floods in 1995-96 followed by a severe drought in 1997 have resulted in increasingly
serious food shortages. Substantial grain shipments from Japan and South Korea
are offsetting a portion of the losses. North Korea remains far behind South
Korea in economic development and living standards.
