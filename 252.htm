<p>
<b>Economy&#151;overview:</b> After Russia, the Ukrainian republic was far and away the most important
economic component of the former Soviet Union, producing about four times
the output of the next-ranking republic. Its fertile black soil generated
more than one-fourth of Soviet agricultural output, and its farms provided
substantial quantities of meat, milk, grain, and vegetables to other republics.
Likewise, its diversified heavy industry supplied equipment and raw materials
to industrial and mining sites in other regions of the former USSR. Ukraine
depends on imports of energy, especially natural gas. Shortly after the implosion
of the USSR in December 1991, the Ukrainian Government liberalized most prices
and erected a legal framework for privatization, but widespread resistance
to reform within the government and the legislature soon stalled reform efforts
and led to some backtracking. Output in 1992-97 fell to less than half the
1991 level. Loose monetary policies pushed inflation to hyperinflationary
levels in late 1993. Since his election in July 1994, President KUCHMA has
pushed economic reforms, maintained financial discipline, and tried to remove
almost all remaining controls over prices and foreign trade. Implementation
of KUCHMA's economic agenda is encountering considerable resistance from parliament,
entrenched bureaucrats, and industrial interests; and an environment of corruption
continues to discourage foreign investors. One signal achievement has been
the reduction of the inflation rate to 10% by yearend 1997. If KUCHMA succeeds
in implementing aggressive market reforms during 1998, the economy should
reverse its downward trend, with real growth occurring by late 1998 and into
1999.
